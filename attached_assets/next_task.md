# 📌 NEXT TASK – Replit Agent Build Guide (Auto Updated per Phase)

📅 Date: 2025-06-23

🧠 Task:
Implement the `strategy_condition_router.py` module from **Phase 9: Strategy Behavior & Logic**.

🔧 File to Create:
`/desktop-app/strategy_condition_router.py`

🧩 Description:
Build a strategy condition router that routes signals through different processing paths based on configurable conditions and market states.

Key Features:

* Route signals through different strategy modules based on conditions
* Support for conditional logic with market state evaluation
* Dynamic strategy selection based on volatility, time, and market conditions
* Integration with all existing strategy modules (reverse, grid, multi-signal)
* Fallback routing and error handling for strategy failures
* Performance monitoring and strategy effectiveness tracking

🧪 Required Tests:
`/desktop-app/tests/test_strategy_condition_router.py`

* Test condition evaluation and routing logic
* Test strategy module integration and execution
* Test fallback mechanisms and error handling
* Test performance monitoring and statistics

📂 Tracking Instructions:

* ✅ Update `/attached_assets/feature_status.md`
* 📘 Append log in `/attached_assets/dev_changelog.md`
* 🧾 Register task in `/attached_assets/execution_history.md`

❗ Rules:

* Implement flexible condition evaluation system
* All logs must go to `/logs/strategy_condition_router.log`
* Ensure routing logic prevents strategy conflicts
