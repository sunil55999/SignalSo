Audit the SignalOS backend for missing or incomplete features, with a special focus on the following areas:

Full Offline-First Operation

Implement comprehensive offline capabilities: local AI signal parsing, signal queuing, trading, and robust, automated sync with conflict resolution after reconnect.

Ensure all user and system actions performed offline are securely queued, then synchronized and merged seamlessly when server connectivity is restored.

Plugin & Marketplace Ecosystem

Accelerate development and public launch of the provider/plugin marketplace.

Enable dynamic onboarding and management of third-party provider modules and user-contributed strategies from within the backend and admin console.

Provide robust, documented APIs for plugin lifecycle (install, activate, rate, update).

Prop Firm/Regulatory Mode Support

Add prebuilt compliance and restriction modes for different prop firm requirements and regional regulatory rules.

Centralize compliance configuration and expose secure APIs for mode switching and enforcement.

Onboarding API Support

Develop and expose all backend workflows necessary to power step-by-step onboarding flows and interactive setup wizards in the UI.

Include guided “connect, test, validate” routes for providers, integrations, and account settings.

(Optional) Two-Factor Authentication

If future user requests demand, implement optional 2FA flows with backend support for code delivery, verification, and recovery.

For Each Gap Identified:

Describe the specific area or endpoint(s) missing or needing enhancement.

Implement the required backend endpoints, database models, workflow logic, and API documentation.

Write comprehensive automated tests for each fix or new function.

Update associated system monitoring, audit logging, and error-handling as necessary.

Document usage and integration steps for frontend/UI teams.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

All identified areas are fully implemented, tested, and documented.

API docs and backend changelogs reflect new features and fixes.

System health, analytics, compliance, and extensibility match or surpass current leading competitors.
