# 📈 SignalOS Final Upgrade Execution Plan

> 🧠 Goal: Complete all remaining feature categories to achieve 100% parity with commercial-grade signal copiers like TSC, while integrating SignalOS-exclusive innovations. 🎯 Scope: Replit-only execution with strict file tracking and modular architecture.

## 🧪 Phase 9 – Testing & QA

- Each module must have:
  - `/desktop-app/tests/`
  - `/server/tests/`
  - `/client/__tests__/`
- Validate:
  - Retry, replay, partials
  - Signal override, delayed orders
  - Shadow mode execution (with vs. without SL/TP)

---

## 🔁 File Updates After Every Task

After each module is complete, update:

- `dev_changelog.md`
- `execution_history.md`
- `feature_status.md`
- `next_task.md`

> Replit Agent must begin each session by reading `next_task.md` to avoid duplication or stale logic.
