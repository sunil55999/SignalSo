Backend Completion & QA Verification Prompt
Prompt:

Review the entire backend for SignalOS and confirm it is fully completed, stable, and bug-free by providing clear evidence for each area below:

1. API & Endpoint Coverage

List all API routes with request/response examples.

Confirm that every planned feature/module has an exposed, documented, and tested endpoint.

2. Backend Functionality Checklist

Provide a feature checklist mapped to business requirements (auth, licensing, import/export, integration, parsing, trading, analytics, system health, config, notifications, audit, advanced features).

Show proof that ALL critical functions are implemented and working.

3. Automated Test Coverage

Attach current automated test results (unit, integration, acceptance).

Share test case summaries, code coverage percentage, and a log of last successful full test run.

Prove all critical workflows (auth, trade, license, sync, offline) pass with zero errors.

4. Error & Exception Handling

Detail how errors are logged, reported, and surfaced to users/monitoring.

Prove that all endpoints and background processes fail gracefully, log all unexpected issues, and that recovery/alerts are in place.

5. Performance & Load Testing

Provide results for performance benchmarks under peak load (req/sec, response latency, CPU/memory usage).

Ensure no instability or leaks when processing bulk imports, concurrent trades, or sync jobs.

6. Security & Data Integrity

Describe measures for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and data validation.

Confirm encrypted handling of all sensitive data and secure error logging.

7. Documentation & Deployment

Attach API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI), ER diagrams, and deployment instructions.

Confirm all documentation is current and matches the deployed system.

8. Final Verification

Confirm a successful end-to-end test of every business-critical workflow through the UI and/or API.

Share any known issues or limitations.

Result:
A clear, comprehensive report proving the backend is bug-free, stable, and completely production-ready for integration with the SignalOS desktop app and other clients.
