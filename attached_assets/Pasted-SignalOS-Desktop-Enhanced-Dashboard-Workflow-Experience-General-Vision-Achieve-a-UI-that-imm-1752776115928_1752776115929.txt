SignalOS Desktop: Enhanced Dashboard & Workflow Experience
General Vision:

Achieve a UI that immediately communicates system status, actionable trading insights, and user control—more like a Bloomberg terminal for signal automation, not just a copier.

Key Additions & Improvements:

System Health Central:

Integrate real-time status indicators for every core module (Parser, MT5 Bridge, Licensing, Telegram, AI Engine).

Add animated or color-dynamic signals for warnings, errors, and needs-attention items.

Actionable Recent Activity & Notifications:

Display log/event timeline with filters (errors/warnings/success/info).

Mark unresolved alerts with badges; allow quick resolution/diagnostics from popups.

Smart Trading Metrics:

Surface today’s performance: number of signals processed, win rate, execution speed, and parsing confidence.

Compact mini-panels for account equity, risk usage, daily PnL, and prop-firm rules status.

Strategy & Parser Insights:

Integrate a “Test Strategy” button and quick backtest link.

Show parser confidence percentage and a tooltip or warning if any AI or regex fallback was triggered.

Offer a “Replay Signal” feature to review how recent trades/signals were processed.

Quick Access Panel:

One-click access to logs, settings, license info, and support/help.

Floating or sidebar shortcuts for commonly used actions (pause automation, reload, manual signal input).

Visual Layering & Hierarchy:

Use subtle gradients, shadows, and clear grouping to separate key sections (status, activity, performance).

Apply brand accent color to highlight interactive elements and system health.

Accessibility & Responsive Design:

Ensure all critical metrics are readable at a glance, even on smaller screens or lower resolutions.

Light/dark mode toggle for better usability.

Future-Proofing:

Reserve space for “Marketplace”, “Signal Credibility”, and “Strategy Builder” widgets in future phases.

Design Reference:

Draw on the clarity and actionable nature of dashboards like TradingView, Bloomberg Terminal, or Binance Pro—focusing on clarity, speed, and user empowerment.
