Recommended Core Modifications
A. Enhance Dashboard Structure
Replace static summary cards with "Mission Control" live tiles—balance, PnL, license, real-time module health.

Add a persistent, floating Quick Actions bar: Import, Backtest, Pause, Add Provider, Help.

B. Integrate Advanced Performance & Analytics
Smart analytics panels for:

Parsing accuracy/confidence

Execution latency

Equity and PnL trends (mini-charts)

Provider/strategy snapshot metrics

C. Implement Interactive Activity Timeline
Filterable live feed for trade events, errors, signals, and system health—drilldown reveals actionable context and options (retry, acknowledge, investigate).

D. Build Provider & Strategy Intelligence Widgets
Consolidated provider table with live status, testing, analytics, and quick connect/disconnect.

Visual strategy board: active rule display, backtest button, assignment controls, edit simulation in-place.

E. Always-On Risk & Compliance Panel
Display live exposure, open trades, prop firm rules status, with warnings, and one-click to view or resolve risk events.

F. Centralized Notification & Support Hub
All alerts/errors/updates filterable in a notification center—actions to resolve, mute, or get help.

Add onboarding/tutorial wizard for new users or after major updates.

G. Customization, Accessibility, and Experience
Allow users to customize/pin/rearrange panels.

Ensure light/dark mode toggle, high-contrast settings, keyboard navigation, and tooltip help for complex metrics.
