## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS

1. **Core Trading Infrastructure:** Highly sophisticated with 33 specialized modules covering advanced trading scenarios
2. **Strategy System:** Comprehensive rule-based strategy runtime with JSON configuration
3. **Risk Management:** Extensive implementation including break-even, trailing stops, margin checking, spread filtering
4. **Telegram Integration:** Robust bot system with command interpretation and alert management
5. **Prop Firm Compliance:** Advanced stealth features including lot randomization and end-of-week SL removal
6. **Missing Core Parser:** No dedicated signal parsing engine found despite references throughout codebase

**Overall Assessment:** The SignalOS Desktop App shows exceptional implementation depth for advanced trading features but lacks some fundamental parsing and MT5 bridge components that are referenced but not present in the examined codebase.
