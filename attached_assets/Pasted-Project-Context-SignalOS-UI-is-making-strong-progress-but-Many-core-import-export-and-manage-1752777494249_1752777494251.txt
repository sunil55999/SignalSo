Project Context
SignalOS UI is making strong progress, but:

Many core import, export, and management functions are not fully accessible or operational through the UI.

The current workflow is less streamlined and less user-friendly than TSC, especially for importing signals, strategies, and provider management.

Main Problems to Fix
Unconnected Core Functions: Importing, linking, and managing signals/providers/strategies are not seamless or fully available via the UI.

Lack of UX Feedback: Users don‚Äôt see immediate progress, errors, or success when taking these actions from the UI.

Difficult Onboarding: Users lack guided wizards, one-click integrations, or intuitive bulk operations.

Poor Discoverability: Actions are hidden or multiple clicks away, slowing workflow and increasing frustration.

üßë‚Äçüíª For the Development & UI/UX Team
1. Wire ALL Import/Export and Provider Functions to the UI
Expose importing of signals, strategies, and providers directly from the main dashboard or a persistent sidebar.

Allow import via drag-and-drop (CSV, JSON, PDF), and show real-time parsing/validation (surface errors/warnings before confirming).

2. Add Robust Feedback for Every User Action
After each import/export, display modal or toast with:

Progress bar (during upload/processing)

Inline errors (duplicates, invalid fields, unsupported file formats)

Clear final status (Success/Fail) with ‚ÄúNext Action‚Äù buttons (e.g., Backtest now, Assign provider)

All errors must be contextual and provide actionable suggestions.

3. Implement a Guided Onboarding Wizard
Guide new users through setup: connecting Telegram, importing initial providers/strategies, test parsing a demo signal.

Use step-by-step visual progress, tooltips, inline help, and auto-detection (e.g., scan for accessible Telegram channels they belong to).

4. Create a Global ‚ÄúImport‚Äù & ‚ÄúTest‚Äù Panel
Add a prominent, always-visible ‚ÄúImport‚Äù (and ‚ÄúTest Strategy‚Äù) button on the top bar or sidebar.

After import, show summary and instant option to assign, backtest, or troubleshoot imported items.

5. Enhance the Activity/Notification Center
Log every import/export with timestamp, file details, affected items.

Allow users to undo or revisit past imports with a click.

6. Improve Discoverability & Workflow Speed
Ensure the most-used actions (import, test, assign, connect Telegram) are 1‚Äì2 clicks away from anywhere.

Use badges, banners, or highlights to alert users to unresolved issues from imports or integrations.

üéØ Success = End Result
Every import/export/management task can be executed and tracked entirely through the UI with real-time feedback

Errors are actionable, visible, and easy to fix immediately

Users get contextual guidance and rapid onboarding

All new signals/providers/strategies are ready-to-use within seconds

Benchmark your flows against TSC. If any workflow is longer, less discoverable, or gives less feedback, redesign until it‚Äôs faster and clearer.

‚è© Deliverable
A revised desktop application build where:

All import, export, connection, and basic management features operate directly from the UI.

No core function is left ‚Äúbackend-only.‚Äù

Users can complete onboarding and setup without referring to documentation or making support requests.
