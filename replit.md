# SignalOS - Trading Automation Platform

## Overview

SignalOS is a comprehensive trading automation platform that parses Telegram signals, executes trades on MT5, and provides real-time monitoring through a web dashboard. The system consists of three main components: a Python desktop application for signal processing and MT5 integration, an Express.js server with TypeScript for API services, and a React web dashboard for monitoring and administration.

## Status: Production Ready with Complete Synchronization

All critical synchronization issues have been resolved. The system now features robust real-time communication between web dashboard, backend server, and desktop application with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for client-side bundling
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Context-based auth provider with protected routes

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Session Management**: Express-session with PostgreSQL session store
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and bcrypt password hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support for real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured error responses

### Desktop Application Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Components**: Modular design with separate engines for parsing, retry logic, sync, and strategy execution
- **Integration**: Direct MT5 connection via MetaTrader 5 Python library
- **Communication**: HTTP API client for server synchronization and Telegram bot for remote control

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definition in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Tables**: Users, channels, strategies, signals, trades, MT5 status, and sync logs
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management

### Authentication System
- **Strategy**: Passport Local Strategy with session-based authentication
- **Password Security**: Scrypt hashing with salt for secure password storage
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store using connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with user roles

### Signal Processing Pipeline
- **Parser**: AI-powered signal parsing with confidence scoring
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for signal data integrity
- **Storage**: Structured signal storage with parsed metadata
- **Execution**: Conditional strategy runtime for trade execution logic

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for dashboard and live trading data
- **Auto-sync**: Desktop app synchronization with configurable intervals
- **Status Monitoring**: MT5 connection health and performance tracking

## Data Flow

1. **Signal Ingestion**: Telegram signals are parsed by the desktop app's signal parser
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Parsed signals receive confidence scores based on AI analysis
3. **Strategy Evaluation**: Strategy runtime engine evaluates signals against user-defined rules
4. **Trade Execution**: Valid signals are executed on MT5 with retry logic for failed attempts
5. **Synchronization**: Desktop app syncs trade data and status with the server
6. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time WebSocket updates provide live dashboard data
7. **Remote Control**: Telegram copilot bot allows remote monitoring and control

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Primary**: PostgreSQL 15+ via Neon serverless connection
- **Connection**: WebSocket-based connection with connection pooling
- **Backup**: Optional backup database URL for redundancy

### Trading Platform
- **MetaTrader 5**: Direct integration for trade execution
- **Connection**: Configurable server, login, and path settings
- **Monitoring**: Real-time connection status and health checks

### Communication Services
- **Telegram Bot API**: For copilot bot functionality and signal monitoring
- **WebSocket Server**: Built-in WebSocket server for real-time dashboard updates

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend bundling with hot module replacement
- **ESBuild**: Server-side bundling for production builds
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and compilation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Environment
- **Server**: Node.js application with PM2 process management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Containerization**: Docker support with multi-stage builds
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx configuration for static assets and API routing

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Replit-based development with live reloading
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or cloud-hosted development database
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite dev server with proxy configuration for API routes

### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless server design allows for multiple instances
- **Database**: Connection pooling and query optimization for high throughput
- **WebSocket**: Scaling considerations for real-time connections
- **Caching**: Redis integration for session storage and caching
