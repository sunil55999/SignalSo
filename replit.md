# SignalOS - Trading Automation Desktop App

## Overview

SignalOS is a Python desktop application for trading automation that parses Telegram signals and executes trades on MT5. The application includes comprehensive signal processing, risk management, and trade execution engines.

## Status: Production Ready with Complete Synchronization

All critical synchronization issues have been resolved. The system now features robust real-time communication between web dashboard, backend server, and desktop application with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## System Architecture

### Desktop Application Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Components**: Modular design with separate engines for parsing, retry logic, sync, and strategy execution
- **Integration**: Direct MT5 connection via MetaTrader 5 Python library
- **Communication**: HTTP API client for server synchronization and Telegram bot for remote control

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definition in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Tables**: Users, channels, strategies, signals, trades, MT5 status, and sync logs
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management

### Authentication System
- **Strategy**: Passport Local Strategy with session-based authentication
- **Password Security**: Scrypt hashing with salt for secure password storage
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store using connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with user roles

### Signal Processing Pipeline

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for dashboard and live trading data
- **Auto-sync**: Desktop app synchronization with configurable intervals
- **Status Monitoring**: MT5 connection health and performance tracking

## Data Flow

1. **Signal Ingestion**: Telegram signals are parsed by the desktop app's signal parser
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Parsed signals receive confidence scores based on AI analysis
3. **Strategy Evaluation**: Strategy runtime engine evaluates signals against user-defined rules
4. **Trade Execution**: Valid signals are executed on MT5 with retry logic for failed attempts
5. **Synchronization**: Desktop app syncs trade data and status with the server
6. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time WebSocket updates provide live dashboard data
7. **Remote Control**: Telegram copilot bot allows remote monitoring and control

## External Dependencies
