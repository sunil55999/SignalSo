# SignalOS Backend Audit Report
*Generated: January 18, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies 5 critical areas requiring implementation or enhancement to meet production standards and competitive requirements.

## 1. Full Offline-First Operation 🔴 CRITICAL GAP

### Current State
- ✅ Basic queue system exists (`QueueTask` model)
- ❌ No offline signal parsing capability
- ❌ No conflict resolution for offline actions
- ❌ No sync mechanism after reconnect

### Required Implementation
- **Offline Signal Parser**: Local AI processing when disconnected
- **Offline Queue System**: Store all actions offline
- **Sync Engine**: Conflict resolution and merge logic
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite offline storage

### Business Impact
- **HIGH**: Users cannot trade during connection issues
- **COMPETITIVE**: Industry standard for professional trading platforms

## 2. Plugin & Marketplace Ecosystem 🟡 PARTIAL

### Current State
- ✅ Future marketplace structure exists
- ❌ No plugin installation/management APIs
- ❌ No plugin lifecycle management
- ❌ No marketplace database models

### Required Implementation
- **Plugin Management API**: Install, activate, update, remove
- **Marketplace Database**: Plugin metadata, ratings, versions
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Sandboxed execution environment
- **Provider Integration**: Third-party strategy modules

### Business Impact
- **MEDIUM**: Limits platform extensibility and revenue streams
- **GROWTH**: Essential for ecosystem development

## 3. Prop Firm/Regulatory Mode Support 🔴 CRITICAL GAP

### Current State
- ❌ No regulatory mode configuration
- ❌ No prop firm restriction modes
- ❌ No compliance API endpoints

### Required Implementation
- **Compliance Engine**: Rule-based restriction system
- **Regulatory Profiles**: Pre-built compliance configurations
- **API Endpoints**: Mode switching and enforcement
- **Audit Trail**: Compliance logging and reporting

### Business Impact
- **HIGH**: Blocks enterprise and prop firm customers
- **REVENUE**: Significant market segment loss

## 4. Onboarding API Support 🟡 MISSING

### Current State
- ❌ No step-by-step onboarding endpoints
- ❌ No guided setup wizards
- ❌ No provider connection testing

### Required Implementation
- **Onboarding Workflows**: Step-by-step API endpoints
- **Setup Wizards**: Interactive configuration flows
- **Connection Testing**: Provider and integration validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Onboarding completion status

### Business Impact
- **MEDIUM**: Poor user experience and adoption
- **RETENTION**: Higher churn due to setup complexity

---

## 5. Two-Factor Authentication 🟡 OPTIONAL

### Current State
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ❌ No 2FA support
- ❌ No OTP delivery system

### Required Implementation
- **2FA Integration**: TOTP/SMS support
- **OTP Delivery**: Email/SMS/Authenticator app
- **Recovery System**: Backup codes and recovery flows
- **Session Management**: Enhanced security controls

### Business Impact
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have for security-conscious users
- **TRUST**: Enhanced security posture
