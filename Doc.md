## Security Architecture Improvements

### Desktop Application Security Components
1. **Safe Expression Evaluator**: Replaces eval() with controlled AST evaluation
2. **Secure File Handler**: Prevents directory traversal and validates all file operations
3. **Secure MT5 Bridge**: Comprehensive trading API protection with validation
4. **API Client Security**: Authenticated requests with retry logic and error handling

### Server-Side Security Components
1. **Authentication System**: Session-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
2. **Input Validation**: Express-validator with comprehensive sanitization rules
3. **WebSocket Security**: Session-based authentication with timeout protection
4. **Database Security**: Parameterized queries with transaction management
5. **Content Security Policy**: Helmet with strict CSP configuration
6. **Role-Based Authorization**: Hierarchical permission system

### Security Best Practices Implemented
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management with proper cookie configuration
- Protection against CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection attacks
- File upload security with type and size validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Process-level error handling for graceful degradation
